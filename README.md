# Course-Wise-GPA-Calculator
This project is a Course-Wise GPA Calculator based on multiple linear regression. It predicts a student's GPA in a particular course based on their performance.

About the Project:
This was my first machine learning project, developed after learning the basics. Although it uses a small dataset, it provides a thorough understanding of relative grading in a course.

The goal of this project is to predict a student's GPA in a course relative to the performance of other students. The GPA is calculated using three parameters:

Mid-Semester Examination (out of 20)
Internal Evaluation (out of 30)
End-Semester Examination (out of 50)
